# Dog Breed Prediction Dataset

This dataset is designed for training and evaluating models for dog breed prediction. It contains images of dogs from various breeds, labeled with their respective breed names. The dataset is ideal for machine learning and deep learning projects focused on image classification and computer vision.

## Dataset Description

- **Number of Images**: The dataset includes a substantial number of images, each representing a different dog.
- **Number of Breeds**: The dataset covers a wide range of dog breeds, providing a comprehensive set for training robust models.
- **Image Format**: All images are in JPEG format and have been resized to a consistent dimension to facilitate model training.
- **Labels**: Each image is labeled with the corresponding dog breed, making it easy to use for supervised learning tasks.

## Usage

This dataset can be used for various purposes, including but not limited to:
- Training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for dog breed classification.
- Evaluating the performance of different machine learning models on dog breed prediction tasks.
- Experimenting with transfer learning techniques using pre-trained models like CNN, KNN, RF, SVM, DT.
